# RebootStep - Work in Progress

## Status: DISABLED (.wip extension)

## Reason

RebootStep.kt.wip is a comprehensive reboot verification system that requires architectural integration changes that are beyond the scope of the current Connection API migration.

### Technical Blocker

The file expects to access a connection via:
```kotlin
val connection = flow?.serverFactory?.remoteServiceConnection as? Connection
```

However, this integration point (`remoteServiceConnection`) does not currently exist in the `ServerFactory` architecture. Implementing RebootStep requires:

1. **ServerFactory Modification**: Add `remoteServiceConnection` property
2. **Flow Integration**: Ensure flows properly expose the connection
3. **Lifecycle Management**: Integrate reboot step into installation flows
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Create test harness for reboot verification

### Scope of Work

Enabling RebootStep is a **P2 enhancement** that would require:
- 8-16 hours of development
- Modifications to core ServerFactory architecture
- New test infrastructure
- Documentation updates

### Current State

- ✅ Code is complete and well-documented
- ✅ All logic is implemented
- ❌ Integration points not available in current architecture
- ❌ No tests (would need mock infrastructure)

### Alternative

For now, system reboots can be performed manually or via custom scripts. The reboot verification logic in this file can serve as a reference for future implementation.

### Future Work

To enable RebootStep:
1. Add `remoteServiceConnection: Connection` property to `ServerFactory`
2. Initialize connection in ServerFactory initialization
3. Expose connection via flows
4. Enable RebootStep (remove .wip extension)
5. Add integration tests
6. Document usage in installation step documentation
