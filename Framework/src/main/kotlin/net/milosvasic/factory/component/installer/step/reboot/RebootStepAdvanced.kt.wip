/**
 * ADVANCED REBOOT STEP - Work in Progress
 *
 * This file contains an advanced reboot implementation with:
 * - Platform detection (systemd, sysvinit, OpenRC)
 * - Virtualization detection (QEMU/KVM vs physical hardware)
 * - Pre-reboot health checks
 * - Boot ID verification
 * - Connection dropout detection
 * - Reconnection with exponential backoff
 * - Post-reboot health verification (systemd, network, disk, etc.)
 * - BIOS/POST delay handling
 *
 * STATUS: Disabled (.wip extension)
 *
 * REASON: Requires new Connection API integration with ServerFactory
 * The advanced implementation needs the remoteServiceConnection property
 * which is now available in ServerFactory. However, it requires refactoring
 * to work with the RemoteOperationInstallationStep architecture.
 *
 * CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION: RebootStep.kt provides basic reboot functionality
 *
 * FUTURE WORK: Integrate advanced features when architecture supports it
